# udemy_mysql_assignment

I completed **The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: SQL Beginner to Expert** course on Udemy, taught by Colt Steele. This course provided comprehensive SQL knowledge, and I further reinforced my understanding through hands-on assignments and challenges. The practical exercises helped me gain a deeper, applied understanding of SQL concepts.
